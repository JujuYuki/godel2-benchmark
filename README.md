# godel2-benchmark
Godel 2 benchmark script and example code.

To run, place your own compiled versions of the Godel and migoinfer executables, and run the script.
Runs on Linux, the timings are written in timings.csv at the end of each batch of marking.

Those examples can be used with the Docker-ready `Godel` and `migoinfer` tools as explained 
in the ReadMe file of the [Godel2 repository](https://github.com/JujuYuki/godel2).

Below is a brief description of each example in this repository along with the expected output.
